/* from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43338763/typescript-property-does-not-exist-on-type-object
You probably have allProviders typed as object[] as well. And property country does not exist on object. If you don't care about typing, you can declare both allProviders and countryProviders as Array<any>:
-1-so
let countryProviders: Array<any>;
let allProviders: Array<any>;
--------------------------

-2-oder-so----------------
If you do want static type checking. You can create an interface for the structure and use it:

interface Provider {
    region: string,
    country: string,
    locale: string,
    company: string
}

let countryProviders: Array<Provider>;
let allProviders: Array<Provider>;
